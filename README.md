# Poker Mysterio
Entry for JS13K game competition 2025. Theme: Black Cat

## Background
They say crossing paths with a black cat is bad luck. Poker Mysterio disagrees. In a smoky, comic‑book alley of neon signs and stacked decks, a mischievous black cat pads onto the felt and starts dealing fate with a flick of its tail. Every superstition you’ve heard is here—only this time, the cat’s on your side… mostly.

You’ll build poker hands while the cat toys with probability: a purr to peek at the next draw, a hiss that curses your next score, a pounce that swaps a card at the last second, and a scratch that scars the deck and tilts luck toward the shadows. Think Saturday‑morning comic meets late‑night card table—quick, punchy, a little mysterious.

Cross the cat, tempt superstition, and chase the perfect hand. If luck is a lady, Mysterio is her whiskered accomplice.
